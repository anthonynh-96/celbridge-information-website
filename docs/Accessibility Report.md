## **Accessibility Report**

I spent a good bit of time looking through the Celbridge site and thinking about how easy it is for everyone to use. Accessibility is important as I want anyone who comes to the site to be able to browse the pages easily and no matter what device or ability they have.

Hereâ€™s the main points I picked up:

* **Text and Contrast**  
   The colours are mostly strong enough but in a few spots the background image and the white text can clash a little making it harder to read.

* **Alt Text**  
   Most of the images already have alt text but some of the gallery ones are missing it.

* **Keyboard Navigation**  
   I tested it a bit and you can move through the site with the tab key fine but some of the buttons and the gallery lightbox could be tricky. It could have needes some fine tuning.

* **Font Sizes**  
   The text is generally a good size but I noticed on mobile it can shrink down a bit.

Overall the site is pretty accessible and for those visually impaired, the live caption does pick up what is on screen correctly.
